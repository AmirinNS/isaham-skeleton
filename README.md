# isaham-skeleton
iSaham Skeleton is a mini framework for developing website.

## Notice
For any new iSaham member, you should learn python and version control management (We use [git](https://git-scm.com)). 

We assume you should be able to do some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding. For beginner, we recommend to learn from [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com)

## Installation

Make sure your computer have python 2.xx installed
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install BottlePy. You probably don't have to download pip if you already install python before. Download python 2.xx [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```bash
pip install bottle
```

## Usage

Clone the skeleton using git. If you don't have git program, just download and install from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirinNS/isaham-skeleton.git
```
After finished, you can open any text editor such [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com)

Noted that you can only add static files such as images, css and js into static folder. You can't delete files that already exist in this skeleton. Any modification will be ignored and may lead to error during integration with actual server
